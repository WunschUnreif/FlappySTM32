\section{Example 1}

The well known Pythagorean theorem \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\) was 
proved to be invalid for other exponents. 
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:
 
\[ x^n + y^n = z^n \]

 An alternative:

    \begin{math}
        7+12+x=10
    \end{math}

In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation $E=mc^2$, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.

The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation
 
$$E=mc^2$$
 
discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein. 
In natural units ($c$ = 1), the formula expresses the identity
 
\begin{equation}
E=m
